## Installation and Usage

#### Install the binary

```
go get github.com/drypycode/port-scanner
```

#### Clone the Repo

```
git clone github.com/drypycode/port-scanner
...
go run main.go
```

#### Command line arguments

```
Usage of ./main:
  -hosts string
        A list DNS names or IP addresses (local or remote) delimited by ','. Additionally, for IP addresses
        the user can provide a valid CIDR notation block, and the range of IPs defined in that block will
        be scanned.

        Ex. "127.0.0.1, www.google.com, 192.0.0.0/24, 100.0.0.0-100.0.1.0"

        WARNING: A large range of IP addresses compounds exponentially against the list of ports to scan. 10 hosts @ 10k ports == 100k total scans

        (default "127.0.0.1")

  -ports string
        A list of specific ports delimited by ','. Optionally: A range of ports can be provided in addition to to comma delimited specific ports.

        Ex. "80, 443, 100-200, 6543"

  -protocol string
        Specify the protocol for the scanned ports. (default "TCP")

  -timeout int
        Specify the timeout to wait on a port on the server. (default 5000)
```

#### Example Usage

```
âžœ  go run main.go --ports="80,4423,100-105,40-45" --hosts='127.0.0.1,google.com,facebook.com'
